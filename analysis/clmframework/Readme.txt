For Windows this software comes prepackaged with all the necessary binaries and dll's for compilation of the project, you still need to compile it in order to run it. You don't need to download anything additional, just open "CLM_framework_vs2012.sln" using Visual Studio 2012 (or "CLM_framework.sln" using Visual Studio 2010, however 2012 version is more thoroughly tested) and compile the code. The project was built and tested on Visual Studio 2010 and 2012 (can't guarantee compatibility with other versions). Code was tested on Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 can't guarantee compatibility with other Windows versions. NOTE be sure to run the project without debugger attached and in Release mode for speed (if running from Visual Studio), this can be done by using CTRL + F5 instead of F5, this can mean the difference between running at 5fps and 30fps on 320x240px videos.

For Unix based systems and different compilers, I included Cmake files for cross-platform and cross-IDE support. For running the code on Ubuntu please see readme-ubuntu.txt.

You have to respect boost, TBB, dlib, and OpenCV licenses.

--------------- Useful API calls ---------------------------------

CLM class is the main class you will interact with, it performs the main landmark detection algorithms and stores the results. The interaction with the class is declared mainly in the CLMTracker.h, and will require an initialised CLM object. 

The best way to understand how landmark detection is performed in videos or images is to just compile and run SimpleCLM and SimpleCLMImg projects, which perform landmark detection in videos/webcam and images respectively. See later in the readme for the command line arguments for these projects.

A minimal code example for landmark detection is as follows:

CLMTracker::CLMParameters clm_parameters;
CLMTracker::CLM clm_model(clm_parameters.model_location);	

CLMTracker::DetectLandmarksInImage(grayscale_image, Mat_<float>(), clm_model, clm_parameters);

A minimal code example for landmark tracking is as follows:

CLMTracker::CLMParameters clm_parameters;
CLMTracker::CLM clm_model(clm_parameters.model_location);	

while(video)
{
	CLMTracker::DetectLandmarksInVideo(grayscale_image, clm_model, clm_parameters);
}

After landmark detection is done clm_model stores the landmark locations and local and global Point Distribution Model parameters inferred from the image. To access them and more use:

2D landmark location (in image):
	clm_model.detected_landmarks contains a double matrix in following format [x1;x2;...xn;y1;y2...yn] describing the detected landmark locations in the image
	
3D landmark location (with respect to camera):
	clm_model.GetShape(fx, fy, cx, cy);
	// fx,fy,cx,cy are camera callibration parameters needed to infer the 3D position of the head with respect to camera, a good assumption for webcams is 500, 500, img_width/2, img_height/2	
	// This returns a column matrix with the following format [X1;X2;...Xn;Y1;Y2;...Yn;Z1;Z2;...Zn], here every element is in millimeters and represents the facial landmark locations with respect to camera
	
3D landmark location in object space:
	clm_model.pdm.CalcShape3D(landmarks_3D, clm_model.params_local);

Head Pose:

	// Head pose is stored in the following format (X, Y, Z, rot_x, roty_y, rot_z)
	// translation is in millimeters with respect to camera centre
	// Rotation is in radians around X,Y,Z axes with the convention R = Rx * Ry * Rz, left-handed positive sign
	// The rotation can be either with respect to camera or world coordinates (for visualisation we want rotation with respect to world coordinates)

	There are four methods in total that can return the head pose
	
	//Getting the head pose w.r.t. camera assuming orthographic projection
	Vec6d GetPoseCamera(CLM& clm_model, double fx, double fy, double cx, double cy, CLMParameters& params);
	
	//Getting the head pose w.r.t. world coordinates assuming orthographic projection
	Vec6d GetPoseWorld(CLM& clm_model, double fx, double fy, double cx, double cy, CLMParameters& params);
	
	//Getting the head pose w.r.t. camera with a perspective camera correction
	Vec6d GetCorrectedPoseCamera(CLM& clm_model, double fx, double fy, double cx, double cy, CLMParameters& params);

	//Getting the head pose w.r.t. world coordinates with a perspective camera correction
	Vec6d GetCorrectedPoseWorld(CLM& clm_model, double fx, double fy, double cx, double cy, CLMParameters& params);

	// fx,fy,cx,cy are camera callibration parameters needed to infer the 3D position of the head with respect to camera, a good assumption for webcams providing 640x480 images is 500, 500, img_width/2, img_height/2	
	
--------------------------- CLM Matlab runners ---------------------------------

These are provided for recreation of some of the experiments described in the papers and to demonstrate the command line interface for Windows.

---- Note about timestamps ------
OpenCV is not good at dealing with variable framerates in recorded videos (or sometimes at reporting the framerate of the video), so the timestamps will not always be accurate. However, the number of frames and their ordering will be correct.

	-device <device_num> the webcam from which to read images (default 0)
	-fdir <directory> run the feature extraction on every image (.jpg and .png) in a directory (the output will be stored in individual files for the whole directory)
	-asvid (if this flag is specified the images in -fdir directory will be treated as if they came from a video, that is they form a sequence, so tracking will be done instead of detection per videos)

--------------------- Basic demos -----------------------------------------

Can run these after compiling the code in Release mode.

Just running SimpleCLM.exe or MultiTrackCLM.exe will track either a single face or multiple (in the case of the latter executable) from the webcam connected to the computer.

Basic landmark detection in images. From Matlab run "matlab_runners/run_demo_images.m", alternatively go to Release folder and from command line execute:

SimpleCLMImg.exe -clmwild -fdir "../videos/" -ofdir "../matlab_runners/demo_img/" -oidir "../matlab_runners/demo_img/"

or

SimpleCLMImg.exe -fdir "../videos/" -ofdir "../matlab_runners/demo_img/" -oidir "../matlab_runners/demo_img/"

Basic landmark tracking in videos. From Matlab run "matlab_runners/run_demo_video.m", alternatively go to Release folder and from command line execute: SimpleCLM.exe -f "../videos/changeLighting.wmv" -f "../videos/0188_03_021_al_pacino.avi" -f "../videos/0217_03_006_alanis_morissette.avi" -f "../videos/0244_03_004_anderson_cooper.avi" -f "../videos/0294_02_004_angelina_jolie.avi" -f "../videos/0417_02_003_bill_clinton.avi" -f "../videos/0490_03_007_bill_gates.avi" -f "../videos/0686_02_003_gloria_estefan.avi" -f "../videos/1034_03_006_jet_li.avi" -f "../videos/1192_01_006_julia_roberts.avi" -f "../videos/1461_01_021_noam_chomsky.avi" -f "../videos/1804_03_006_sylvester_stallone.avi" -f "../videos/1815_01_008_tony_blair.avi" -f "../videos/1869_03_009_victoria_beckham.avi" -f "../videos/1878_01_002_vladimir_putin.avi"

More examples of how to use the command line and more demos can be found in the ./matlab_runners folder and in the Readme.txt there
		
------------ Depth data ------------------------------------------------
Currently depth stream is expected to be in the format of a collection of 8 or 16-bit .png files in a folder with a naming scheme: depth00001.png, depth00002.png, ... depthxxxxx.png, with each .png.
Each depth image is expected to correspond to an intensity image from a video sequence. Colour and depth images are expected to be aligned (a pixel in one is correspondent to a pixel in another).

For example of this sort of data see the ICT-3DHP dataset (http://multicomp.ict.usc.edu/?p=1738)

------------- CLM parameters ---------------------------------------------

The default parameters are already set (they work well enough on the datasets tested (BU, BU-4DFE, ICT-3DHP, and Biwi)), however,
tweaking them might results in better tracking for your specific datasets.

Main ones to tweak can be found in lib\local\CLM\include\CLMParameters.h:

window sizes - window_sizes_current specified window sizes for each scale iteration, if set smaller the tracking accuracy might suffer but it would be faster, setting to larger area would slow down the tracking, but potentially make it more accurate.
validate_detections - if set to true an SVM classifier is used to determine convergence of feature points and make sure it's a face, this is useful to know for reinitialisation
decision_boundary - this is used to determine when the SVM classifier thinks that convergence failed (currently -0.5), decrease for a less conservative boundary (more false positives, but fewer false negatives) and increase to be more conservative (fewer false positives, but more false negatives)

--------------- Results -------------------------------------------------
	
Results that you should expect on running the code on the publicly available datasets can be found in:

matlab_runners/Feature Point Experiments/results/landmark_detections.txt - the results on landmark detection on in the wild dataset

matlab_runners/Head Pose Experiments/results/Pose_clm_ccnf_v1.txt - the results of head pose tracking using CLNF on 3 datasets (BU, BIWI and ICT-3DHP)
matlab_runners/Head Pose Experiments/results/Pose_clm_svr_v1.txt - the results of head pose tracking uding CLM and CLM-Zon 3 datasets (BU, BIWI and ICT-3DHP)

--------------------------------------- Final remarks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

I did my best to make sure that the code runs out of the box but there are always issues and I would be grateful for your understanding that this is research code and not a commercial level product. However, if you encounter any problems/bugs/issues please contact me at Tadas.Baltrusaitis@cl.cam.ac.uk for any bug reports/questions/suggestions.
